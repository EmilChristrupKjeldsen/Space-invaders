@brief Space invaders game startup

@description This is a game i made with p5.js. I gave the game more funtionality later on, but my "startup" type of the game was the only one that still had the functionality to shoot. Therefore this is the game I chose to have as a repository on my Github 

... The game is not complete yet, but a lot of the fundamentals I have learned with the Javascript framework called p5.js, is shown with this game. ... *********************************************************************************************************/
